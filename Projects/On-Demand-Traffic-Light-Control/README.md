# On-demand Traffic light control

## This is a mini project the idia was taken from FWD professional trak.

<br />

The system will use an STM32F103C8 microcontroller and various components, simulated within the Proteus environment, to manage traffic lights for both vehicles and pedestrians. Additionally, we will implement this system using FreeRTOS to ensure real-time operation and efficient multitasking.

### Objectives:

- Control traffic lights for cars and pedestrians within the Proteus simulation environment.
- Efficiently respond to pedestrian crosswalk requests.
- Implement error handling and reporting.
- Utilize FreeRTOS for real-time operation and multitasking.
